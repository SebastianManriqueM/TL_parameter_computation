# CALCULATION OF TRANSMISSION LINE PARAMETERS - julia_start

This repository basic julia scripts for calculating transmission line parameters according to transmission line geometry, conductors and ground wires.

## To DO Datasets
- [ ] Include Alumoweld Ground wires
- [ ] Include EHS Ground wires
## To Do Conductors filters
- [ ] Get typycal conductor based on transmission line dataset
- [ ] Get conductor based on type and nearest kcmil in case it doesn't find the exact kcmil given by the user.
