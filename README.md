# CALCULATION OF TRANSMISSION LINE PARAMETERS - julia_start

This repository basic julia scripts for calculating transmission line parameters according to transmission line geometry, conductors and ground wires.

## To DO Datasets
- [ ] Include Alumoweld Ground wires
- [ ] Include EHS Ground wires
- [ ] Include Transmission line data above 345kV, and update states of TL_Geometry dataset
- [ ] Conductors ACSS, ACSS_TW, ACSR/AW, ACSR/TW
## To Do Conductors filters
- [ ] Get typical conductor based on transmission line dataset
- [ ] Get conductor based on type and nearest kcmil in case it doesn't find the exact kcmil provided by the user.
